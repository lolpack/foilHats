I wanted to see if there was a correlation between aluminum sales (measured by the success of a top aluminum manufacturer) and alien sightings. Evidently there doesn't appear to be evidence to support a relationship between the two, but when has a lack of evidence stopped anyone?

I used D3 to form and manipulate the graph. 

If you want to view the graph in the browser, you'll need to serve the csv file as well. I recommend <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/tech-tip-really-simple-http-server-python">python</a> for this.
